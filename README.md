# Data Structure:
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.Examples: Stacks, Queues, Linked List,Trees, Graphs, Files, Arrays etc. <br>
While there are several basic and advanced structure types, any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. <br>

Data Strucutures are clasified into two types:<br>
  1.<b>Linear data structure</b>: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues etc.<br>
  2.<b>Non-Linear data structure</b>: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: Trees and graphs etc.
<br><br>
### Abstract Data Types(ADTs):
In general, system defined data types (premitive data types: int,float,char etc) support operations such as addition, subtraction etc because system provides the implementation for the premitive data types. But for user defined data types we need to define the operations.<br>
ADTs consists of two parts:<br>
1. Declaration of data
2. Declaration of operations such as insertion,deletion,pop,push etc.
