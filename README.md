# Data Structure:
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.Examples: Stacks, Queues, Linked List,Trees, Graphs, Files, Arrays etc. <br>
While there are several basic and advanced structure types, any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. <br>

Data Strucutures are clasified into two types:
  1. <b>Linear data structure</b>: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues etc.
  2. <b>Non-Linear data structure</b>: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: Trees and graphs etc.
<br><br>

## Algorithm:
Step by step instructions to solve a problem.

### Abstract Data Types(ADTs):
In general, system defined data types (premitive data types: int,float,char etc) support operations such as addition, subtraction etc because system provides the implementation for the premitive data types. But for user defined data types we need to define the operations.<br>
ADTs consists of two parts:
1. Declaration of data
2. Declaration of operations such as insertion,deletion,pop,push etc.

#### Why the Analysis of Algorithms? 
To go from cily "A" to city "B", there can be many ways of accomplishing this: by flight, by bus, by train and also by bicycle. Depending on the availability and convenience, we choose the one that suits us. Similarly, in computer science, multiple algorithms are  available for solving the same problem (for example, a sorting problem has many algorithms, like insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and many more). Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed. 

#### Goal of the Analysis of Algorithms 
The goal of the analysis of" algorithms is to compare algorithms (or solutions) mainly in terms of running lime but also in terms of other factors (e.g., memory, developer effort, etc.) 

#### What is Running Time Analysis? 
It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size) increases. Input size is the number of elements in the input, and depending on the problem type, the input may be of different types. The following are the common types of inputs. 
  * Size of an array 
  * Polynomial degree 
  * Number of elements in a matrix 
  * Number of bits in the binary representation of the input 
  * Vertices and edges in a graph. 
  
#### How to Compare Algorithms 
To compare algorithms, let us define a few objective measures:<br> 
<b>Execution times?</b> Not a good measure as execulion times are specific lo a particular computer. <br>
<b>Number of statements executed?</b> Not a good measure, since the number of statements varies wilh the programming language as well as the style of the individual programmer. <br>
<b>Ideal solution?</b> Let us assume that we express the running time of a given algorithm as a function of the input size n (i.e., f(n)) and compare these different functions corresponding to running times. This kind of comparison is independent of machine Lime, programming style, etc.
