# Data Structure:
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.Examples: Stacks, Queues, Linked List,Trees, Graphs, Files, Arrays etc. <br>
While there are several basic and advanced structure types, any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. <br>
Data Strucutures are clasified into two types:<br>
  1.<b>Linear data structure</b>: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues etc.<br>
  2.<b>Non-Linear data structure</b>: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: Trees and graphs etc.
